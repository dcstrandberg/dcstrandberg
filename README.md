- 👋 Hi, I’m @dcstrandberg
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, and leveraging data in novel ways to answer interesting questions and create helpful applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ML frameworks for Python, particularly in the image/video recognition space; I'm also learning ReactJS & React-Native to build front-ends for my applications. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on helping people by answering questions and solving problems.
